    <h2>Welcome to my First Blog Page</h2><br/>

  <div class="article">  
    <h2 class="special">Friday</h2>  
    <p><span >(27/2/19)</span> <br/>
        <p>Saw you for the first time in two years, when I finally felt like I moved on,
                There you were, still as beautiful as you were on day 1.</p>
                
                <p>One thing I couldn’t believe was this time you weren’t across the hallway,
                You were right next to me, laying your head on my shoulder, as we strolled around the town.</p>
                
                <p>Prayed to the lord, for this moment to never end,
                You stopped me and took a few steps forward without me, I felt it all again,</p>
                
                <p>It was you, leaving, again</p>
                
                <p>But surprisingly this time, you turned around and asked me to close my eyes,
                Just to remind me of the distance when I woke up from this dream.</p>
                
                <p>Here I am back to where it all started,</p>
                <p>When I finally felt it’s all over,</p> 
                <p>You just gave me a new memory of how your touch used to feel right around my shoulder.</p>
        
        </p>

    <div class="article"> 
         
        <h2><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stranger">Strangers</h2></a> 
          <span>(27/11/17)</span> <br/>
          <p>Strangers. Friends. Best friends. Friends. Strangers.</p> 

          <p>My mistake : Falling for you</p>
          <p>Your mistake : Letting me fall for you</p>
          
          <p>After everything ended for the nth time, I closed the door. I made my decision, finally. Promised myself to never open it.</p> 
          
          <p>6 months later and here you are, starting it all over with a “hey”. It hurts to say no. Hurts to open the door. Kept myself strong enough to not open that door. </p>
          
          <p>Constant battles within me. And I finally did it.</p> 
          
          <p>Left the door open, not for you to just come in. But to come and leave me in pieces,</p>
          
          <p>Like always.</p> 
          </p>
